# StorAI

This is not my finest work but was entirely intended to be a POC and learning opportunity as part of the [Wasp Lang hackathon](https://hackathon.wasp-lang.dev/).

### Goals

1. Learn Wasp
2. Learn Prisma
3. Learn LLMs
4. Create a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game that I could then eventually use for my other "D&D screen-table-top" project

### Lessons Learned

1. How to use Wasp!
   - This took about 2 hours to learn and get setup, thanks Wasp team!
2. Quite a bit around LLMs and how to parse and use their output
3. How to use Prisma
4. How to leverage [langchain](https://js.langchain.com/docs/) library to use the LLMs in a more consistent way

### Things I wish I had time to do

1. Make the interface more glossy, animations and such
2. Make more themes, right now it's a "stolen" sci-fi theme from a [blog post](https://gentlebullco.medium.com/turn-chatgpt-into-an-open-ended-choose-your-own-adventure-game-and-role-play-any-story-you-want-ad4572cb9077)

Overall I'm quite happy with the outcome and the things I've learned. I'm excited to use Wasp for any full-stack application I may need in the future. I hate spending hours with the configurations and such and I don't want to put my applications out in the wild without authentication. Wasp worked great for these requirements as I was able to quickly start writing the frontend code.
