"You walk down the narrow hallway and enter the ship's common area. The room is larger and more spacious than the cramped quarters in which you slept. The floors are a dull gray metal and the walls are adorned with posters displaying different planets and nebulae. The room is furnished with a large dining table with accompanying chairs, a kitchenette, and a couch in front of a holo-screen. You notice 3 crew members, Cal, Gus, and Susana, the ship's AI, sitting at the table, chatting and laughing."
